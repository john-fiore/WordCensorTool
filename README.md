# Word Censor Tool
**Word Censor Tool** is a simple, customizable sandbox-based tool that will censor words using a special character. It's written in Python, and was created for my Computer Programming II class as part of an [Edabit Python Challenge](https://edabit.com/challenge/zJSF5EfPe69e9sJAc).

This is not meant for professional use. It's merely a sandbox meant for you to mess around with.

## How to run it
**Please Note:** Python is required for all of these methods. You can install it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Also, as of 01/08/2025, this program **only works on Windows**. In the future, if wanted, I'll make it compatible with MacOS and Linux.

### Manual Method
1. Download `censor.py`
2. Open your PC's terminal and change your directory to where you downloaded the Python file.
3. Run the file like by entering `python censor.py`.

### Source Code Method
1. Download the source code.
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Run `launch.bat`.
