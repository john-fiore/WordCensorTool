# Word Censor Tool
**Word Censor Tool** is a simple, customizable sandbox-based tool that will censor words using a special character. It's written in Python, and was created for my Computer Programming II class as part of an [Edabit Python Challenge](https://edabit.com/challenge/zJSF5EfPe69e9sJAc).

This is not meant for professional use. It's merely a sandbox meant for you to mess around with.
